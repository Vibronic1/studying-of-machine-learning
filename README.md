# studying-of-machine-learning 

In this repo i tryed to learn some machine learning methods.
 I had 2 Tasks:

 [Task 1](./First%20task/) - Supervised learning
   1. [Decision tree](./First%20task/decision%20tree.py)
   2. [K-nearest neighbors method](./First%20task/k-nearest%20neighbors%20method.py)
   3. [Linear regression](./First%20task/linear%20regression.py)
   4. [Logistic regression](./First%20task/logistic%20model.py)

 [Task 2](./second%20task/) - Recomendation systems
